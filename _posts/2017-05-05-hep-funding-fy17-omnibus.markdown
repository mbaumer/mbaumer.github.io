description: "How High-Energy Physics fared in the FY17 Omnibus Budget"
---

This past Friday, the President signed the compromise budget agreement passed by Congress earlier in the week, the [Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr244/BILLS-115hr244enr.pdf). The "omnibus" bill, which glues together the 11 appropriations bills that had yet to be passed for an up-or-down vote as a single package, protects and even enhances funding for agencies targeted for severe cuts by Trump's "[skinny budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/budget/fy2018/2018_blueprint.pdf)" released on March 16th. This is evidence that despite apparent opposition by the White House, basic research still maintains strong bipartisan support in both houses of Congress.

In addition to other basic research increases, including a $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health, the agencies that fund particle physics and cosmology fared very well, perhaps due to the strong advocacy effort advanced by the research community over the past several years. The table below summarizes the both the increases proposed in President Obama's (first colored column) budget request for fiscal year 2017, and the funding changes now enacted through the omnibus bill (second colored column).

Worthy of note is the fact that the DOE Office of High-Energy Physics is the only office within the DOE Office of Science to receive a larger increase than was requested by President Obama. The level included in the omnibus compromise ($825M), is reflective of the level of funding we requested
