excerpt: "In anticipation of my trip to DC, I investigated how US HEP spending is distributed across states and congressional districts."

From March 29th-31st this year, I will be in Washington, D.C. on behalf of the United States highÂ­-energy physics (HEP) community. I will coming as part of an annual visit to Washington which the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Users Organization conducts jointly with organizations representing the scientists using the facilities of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, and the U.S. users of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland.

From my experience on the trip last year, I know that many offices are concerned not only with the national impact of HEP on technology, innovation, and education, but also with the local economic impact of federal HEP spending in their districts and states. Government data on HEP grants and contracts is scattered across multiple websites and difficult to browse directly. On this page, I have collated federal HEP spending from the following three sources:

1. Grants from the DOE Office of High Energy Physics (within the Office of Science)
2. Contracts from the DOE Office of Science (not all HEP-specific, but mostly related to national laboratory spending, which is essential for HEP)
3. Grants from the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (which contains HEP, along with other research, and is the typical subject of our congressional ask, since Congress does not have budgetary authority below the Directorate level)

One caveat in using this data, in addition to those listed above, is to watch for the effect of re-districting in moving universities (and businesses) across Congressional district boundary lines. Since I include data going back to 2012, institutions may be listed in multiple congressional districts if they changed district during this time. If you encounter any other issues using the website, feel free to write an issue on the project's GitHub page.
