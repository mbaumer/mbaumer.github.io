I'm a physics PhD Student at Stanford University studying the large-scale structure of the universe with the Dark Energy Survey. My research, with my advisor Prof. Aaron Roodman, focuses on looking for direct signatures of the "cosmic web". I previously worked on the ATLAS experiment at LHC as a Gates-Cambridge scholar at Cambridge University, where I wrote a thesis on the rare decay of the Z boson to 4 leptons.
