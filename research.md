# Three-point correlation functions in DES

# Camera Systematics

If the pixels in your iPhone weren't aligned in a perfect grid, you'd expect the picture to be blurry. In survey astronomy, even the slightest distortion of the pixel grid could have a big effect on our observations.

# Lensed Quasar Hunting
With SLAC Staff Scientist [Dr. Phil Marshall](http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~pjm/Site/Welcome.html), and Stanford undergraduate [Jenny Kim](https://github.com/jennykim1016), I work on developing machine learning methods to look for needles (lensed quasars) in haystacks (massive galaxy catalogs). On the ML side, we're training Random Forests and using [Extreme Deconvolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2979) (basically a Gaussian Mixture Model that's aware of observational uncertainties). Right now, we are working on creating realistic training data for these algorithms using the [OM10](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/OM10) catalog, colorized using template SEDs.
