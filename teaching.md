# TA Physics 50: Introduction to Observational Astronomy for non-majors (Fall 2015, Fall 2016)

Being a lab TA for this class is great fun, because it takes place at night up at the Stanford Student Observatory! So not only do I get to help non-scientists wrap their head around the crazy thing that is our universe (one of them told me I "made his senior year" by showing him lunar craters through the eyepiece on the 16"), I get to journey through the entire process of observing with them, from target selection and opening (and hand-steering) the dome, to taking and reducing images. It is a process from which we are, for better or for worse, insulated from as observers at the Blanco telescope in Chile, where we take data for the Dark Energy Survey.

# TA Physics 43: Electricity and Magnetism for Engineers (Spring 2014)

E+M is my favorite subject, so I really enjoyed leading discussion sections and tutoring students one-on-one during office hours and in the Physics Tutoring Center.

# EDUC 285: The Teaching and Learning of Science

This isn't a class I've TA-ed, rather, it's one I'm currently taking from Prof. Carl Weiman. Each week we read primary and secondary literature on education research, and workshop an assignment for a target class (mine's Physics 50) that takes inspriation from the research principles we've discussed during the week. 

As an aside to other grad students out there: You should read one book about teaching, and it should be [this one](https://www.amazon.com/ABCs-How-Learn-Scientifically-Approaches/dp/0393709264). It condenses a huge amount of research into 26 manageable and alphabetical chunks (which you'll learn in chapters E and K is an excellent idea). In addition, it's very open about the limitations of individual studies and educational frameworks--good perspective to have as a practitioner of education.
